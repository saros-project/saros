# {{ page.title }}

Our development workflow bases on the standard [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and consists of the following steps:

1. [Create a remote branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) with a meaningful name
2. Push changes to the new branch
3. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Don't forget to invite reviewers!
4. Improve the pull request (or explain your changes) until the reviewers are satisfied
5. [Squash and merge](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) pull request if:
    * Reviewers approved the pull request
    * The tests in the CI server are successful
