# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the
# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:
#
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
#
gem "jekyll"

# Required for building jekyll with Windows:
## Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
gem "tzinfo-data", platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]

## Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.0" if Gem.win_platform?
gem "jekyll-relative-links", "~> 0.6.1"

gem "jemoji", "~> 0.12.0"
