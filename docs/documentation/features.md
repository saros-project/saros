Saros comes with a **boundle of nice features**.

## Collaborative Real-Time File Editing

The core functionality of Saros is to support collaborative editing of
text files.

The task of Saros is to synchronize the work at any time. 

## Arbitrary Number of Participants

Saros is designed to at least work with two participants in a session -
as inherent for pair programming - but there is no maximum limit of
participants.

## Several concurrent writers

All participants with write-access can edit the shared files at the same
time.

## Various sharing options

You may share multiple projects within one session. You may also share
only a selection of files of a project. If you create, delete or rename
a file/folder in a shared project, it will be created/deleted/renamed at
the session's participants as well.

## Communication

For instant messaging you can use a multi-user or 1-to-1 chat.
In addition, we recommend to make use of your favorite VoIP application
or audio conferencing tool.

## Awareness Information

As a user in a session you can see who of the other participants is
where (file/region) and who just changed what.

## Follow-Mode

The Follow-Mode allows you to continuously observe all navigation and
editing activities of your team members.

## Inconsistency Detection

Saros frequently checks if your copy became out of sync with the host's
copy. In that case, Saros allows you to easily recover from this
inconsistency.

## Whiteboard

Saros provides a concurrent drawing tool for communicating topics
graphically.
