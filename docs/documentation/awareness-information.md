## File Navigations

In the package explorer:
- ![active file](how-tos/images/icons-e/active_file.png) A colored dot decorates the file that a participant has currently
    in focus. The color resembles the color of the active user. If multiple users have the same file focused,
    the dot will turn grey (![multiple active file](images/awareness/eclipse_package_manager_annotated_file_multiple.png)).
- ![shared file](how-tos/images/icons-e/shared_file.png) A
    blue arrow decorates a file that is shared with
    other participants.
