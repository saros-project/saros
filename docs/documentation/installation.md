{% capture eclipse %}

## Prerequisites

*   Saros requires **Java SE 8** or higher
*   Saros is developed and tested using **Eclipse 4.8**, but it
    should work on any newer version without problems.
    *   [Download Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
*   Saros ought to run on all platforms that can execute Eclipse
    cleanly. 
*   If you want to try Saros, you may use our public XMPP/Jabber server
    `saros-con.imp.fu-berlin.de`. However, if you want to use Saros for
    commercial purposes, we recommend
    [setting up your own XMPP server](setup-xmpp.md) for maximum
    control over all exchanged data.

    smooth operation of Saros.
