title: Follow Mode
---

You can use this feature to follow a single participant's navigation
activities and changes. 
* Whenever the followed participant opens an editor for a shared file on
  their computer, a matching editor is opened in your IDE.
* Any time the followed participant switches to view a different shared editor, a matching editor is switched
  to in your IDE.
* As the followed participant scrolls in a shared editor, the local viewpoint is
  moved along accordingly in your IDE to ensure that you see what they see.
  You still have the ability to scroll the local viewpoint on your own,
  but it will still be reset every time the followed user scrolls their editor.

**Prerequisite:** You have to be in a [session with another user](../getting-started.md).
