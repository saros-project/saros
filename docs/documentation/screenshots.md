Let's gather some impressions of Saros.

![Saros
Annotations](images/screenshot_annotated.png)

**There are several features that enable you to remain aware of what
your collaborators are doing.**

1.  Marked and unmarked files. The leftrightarrow shows that the file is currently shared in this saison. The dot is used to see what file is watched, by which user.
2.  Current text selected by another user.
3.  Text changed by another user (by default, the last twenty edits
    are marked).
4.  Current view scope of other users (i.e. what portion of a
    file can they see).

**The main components of the Saros interface.**

5.  The users in the current session. Notice how their color here
    matches their annotations in the editor and their viewed file in the package explorer. If it's more than one user the color change to gray.
6.  The contact list, where all the people known to you are kept.
7.  The chat window. Here you can send instant messages to everyone in
    the current session.

**There is the whiteboard feature that allows you to sketch and share
your ideas with other users.**

8.  The list of tools to sketch the ideas of an user.
    -   If you want to select some drawn ideas, you need to use the
        tools Select and Marquee.

        objects, like ellipse or rectangle, or you can choose the
        freehand pencil.

10. The menu bar of the whiteboard with the functions of undo,
    selecting, copy, pasting, deleting and resizing of
    the sketch-surface.
