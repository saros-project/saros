## What others think 

> Saros (pronounced “zar-ose”, btw) is a set of extensions to Eclipse to
> support real-time collaboration. It is a research prototype at the
> moment, and as such has some rough edges. In 15 or 20 years, most
> programs will be written through real-time collaboration, so for me
> it’s worth a bit of pain today to experience the future.

> Saros has been one of the key factors in being able to accommodate
