## Development Builds

For every push to the `master` branch, a development build is created and released as part of a [GitHub action](https://github.com/saros-project/saros/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild+branch%3Amaster+is%3Asuccess+event%3Apush).
These development builds are kept for 90 days after the action was run.
