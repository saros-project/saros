# Saros

Saros is an Open Source IDE plugin for distributed collaborative software
development.

Note: This is a mirror of xxx which is maintained by a bot, even though it is not marked as "mirror" by Github. Changes go in both directions constantly.

## Details

* All participants of a Saros session have an **identical local copy** of the
  projects they work on.
* They can work in their **usual IDE using all of its features** (currently
  only Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA support is coming soon).
* Saros keeps their copies **in sync**, so everyone can work completely
  **concurrently and in real-time**.
