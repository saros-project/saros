[FIX] The shared project decorator is no longer delayed 
[FIX] #3212089 (In the Create-Account-Waizard you could modify the 
	explaination text below the server entry field.)
[FIX] #3192349 User away image in session window was contrary to reality.
[FIX] Pressing HOME in the JID input field in the AddBuddyWizard makes

	to be more noticeable
[UI] Added "Add Projects..." and "Add Buddies..." to context menu of the 
	session node in the merged roster/session view


11.2.25
=======
[FEATURE] Disable broken partial sharing temporarily until its issues can be resolved.
[FEATURE] Multiple Project Support. Now we have full multiple project support. 
	Any user with write access to the session can add projects to the session. 
	Also a session can be started with more than one project.
[FEATURE] This implements the suggestion from #2707089 to show only viewport 
	annotations for a user on their active editor. The result is the viewport 
	annotations	appear/disappear as a driver activates/deactivates an editor, 
	enabling their peer to be more aware of where they are.
	
[FIX] Google Talk support Users with a Google account (*@gmail.com, 
	*@googlemail.com) can log in using Saros.
[FIX] #3168457. RosterView now displays Saros support immediately after connection.



11.1.28
=======
[REFACTOR, UI] New Wording - Shared Project Session, Host, Driver, Observer, 
	Roster, Jabber, Contact
[FIX] #3124951. When attempting to delete a roster entry, we test if that 
	person is currently in session and throw an error message if so.
[FIX] Theoretical negative integer overflow risk.
[FIX] Send activity immediately after it was added to the outgoing queue, 
	not only at fixed points in time. The minimum interval between sending 
	activities remains the same.
[FIX] Use different kinds of SVN revisions for detecting and replicating changes.


11.1.7
======
[FEATURE] Removed "Share with VCS support..." action, added a 
	setting "Disable VCS support" in the Prefs, default is false. This setting 
	can also be set in the incoming invitation dialog. If the local user has 
	VCS support disabled, VCS operations are completely ignored by Saros 
	(local or remote), whether she's the host or not. If e.g. just one of 
	three participants in a session has problems with the repository, the 
	others could still use it with no real disadvantage.
[FEATURE] Duration between sending of edits is now configurable via 
	the advanced prefs. It has also been reduced to 300ms, which should 
	greatly improve perceived latency.
[FEATURE] Saros now displays an warning when the user tries to 
	delete a shared project. 

[FIX] Use the actual revision (last changed revision) of resources, 
	instead of the latest revision. 
[FIX] #3115698. Only send to observers if there are any.
[FIX] The discovery manager is called when inviting to check if 
	the user supports Saros. If we're not connected, we just quit that check 
	before going to the discovery service. 
[FIX] #3121271: it was possible to rename/delete contacts when 
	disconnected (this failed of course). Now, those options are only enabled 
	when the roster is connected. 
[FIX] Only need the additional \t (or @) when calling 
	Action#setText(). This fixes these weird box characters that were 
	displayed in the account list. 
[FIX] EncodingManipulator error "Could not set encoding on project", 
	PreferenceManager bug.
[FIX] #3133023 Disable "Remove all driver roles" when no driver 
	exists.
[FIX] #3098992 - Inconsistency when concurrently writing at same 
	position. This patch fixes the broken operational transformation. A bunch 
	of received activities was not executed consecutively anymore in the SWT 
	thread and local actions could be executed in between - milliseconds after 
	the transformation but before the execution of the transformation. 


10.11.26
========
[FEATURE/FIX] Fallback mechanism for VCS activities.

[FIX] Bug #3110837; refactored into one account creation wizard; 
	by patrick and christian

	a connection. When achieving a working SOCKS5 bytestream connection the 
	establishing of the other one gets cancelled if still in progress.

[FIX] (k_beecher) #2894542: When the host cannot determine the version of 
	the peer, the current behaviour defaults to reporting the versions as

[FIX] #2789375: SharedProjectFileDecorations not updated / removed
[FIX] #2789102: InvitationDialog cannot be closed initially

[FEEDBACK] Activated our first survey targetting fast user feedback.

[FEATURE] Improved GUI of the ConfigurationWizard, added links to the
Saros project website in all feedback GUI elements, added contact
information to the feedback preference page, added more information
about the statistic submission (link to Wiki-Website)
[FEATURE] Added a feedback system that asks the user to participate in
an online survey. The interval in which the feedback reminder is shown
is customizable or can be disabled completely in the Preferences
[FEATURE] A wizard to configure Saros settings is shown when the plugin
is installed or updated and some user preferences are missing.
[FEATURE] Manually connecting from the Roster View is now always
possible. If configuration details for Jabber are missing a wizard is
shown to enter them right away.
[FEATURE] added StatisticManager which can gather information about the
session. Currently only data about the number of sessions is gathered
and not transmitted at all.
[FEATURE] Added a check button in the invitation dialog that lets the
user specify whether he wants the dialog to close automatically if all
invitations are completed or not.
[FEATURE] Performance: Optimize Operations when transforming to TextEdits
[FEATURE] Added Action to follow a selected person in the SessionView
(FollowThisPersonAction)
[FEATURE] Enable TLS for logging into server (but don't require it,
because we need UI)
[FEATURE] New JIDFileAppender creates log files with the JID of user
currently connected
