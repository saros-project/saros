/**
 * <h1>Undo Module Overview</h1>
 * 
 * The undo module takes care of undoing the last operation made by the 
 * user within a Saros session.
 * In order to not destroy the work made by another user in Saros it is 
 * important to only undo the last own operation made by the user. 
 * Because Eclipse only provides a linear undo mechanism this module is 
 * used to keep track of all operations made by the user for undo/redo 
 * purposes.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>the {@link OperationHistory} of the user's own operations is stored</li>
 * 
 * <li>the {@link UndoManager} only works during a running Saros session</li>
 * </ul>
