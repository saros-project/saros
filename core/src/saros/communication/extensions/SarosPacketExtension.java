/**
 * @JTourBusStop 1, Creating custom network messages, Packet Extensions:
 *
 * <p>We have seen many attempts in the past where developers tried to accomplish things with the
 * existing Saros API which could not be solved because the logic behind the API was lacking of
 * information that was either never present or was available too late.
 *
 * <p>This tour explains how to create custom messages that can be used to exchange needed
 * information.
 *
 * <p>Saros uses XMPP packet extensions (data represented in XML) to exchange its data as messages.
 * This class is the base class to inherit from when creating a new packet extension.
