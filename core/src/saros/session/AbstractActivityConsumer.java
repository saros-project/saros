/**
 * Use this class if you are just interested in some (e.g. just one) Activity type. Just subclass it
 * by overriding the matching {@link IActivityReceiver receive()} methods.
 *
 * <p>Example for a class that is just interested in instances of {@link TextSelectionActivity}:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyConsumingThingy {
 *     private final IActivityConsumer consumer = new AbstractActivityConsumer() {
 *         &#064;Override
 *         public void receive(TextSelectionActivity tsa) {
 *             // ...
 *         }
 *     };
 *
 *     void start() {
 *         sarosSession.addActivityConsumer(consumer);
 *     }
 *
 *     void stop() {
 *         sarosSession.removeActivityConsumer(consumer);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Override the {@link #exec(IActivity) exec()} method, if you want to have more control about what
 * happens before and after activities reach the {@code receive()} methods (or whether activities
 * reach them at all):
 *
 * <pre>
 * IActivityConsumer loggingConsumer = new AbstractActivityConsumer() {
 *     private boolean active = false;
 *
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void exec(IActivity activity) {
 *         if (active) {
 *             LOG.debug(&quot;starting&quot;);
 *             super.exec(activity);
 *             LOG.debug(&quot;done&quot;);
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     &#064;Override
 *     public void receive(TextSelectionActivity tsa) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * };
 * </pre>
