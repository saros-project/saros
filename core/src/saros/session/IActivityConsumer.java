/**
 * Implementations of this class can be {@linkplain
 * ISarosSession#addActivityConsumer(IActivityConsumer, Priority) registered to the SarosSession},
 * so they will be informed when new activities are ready to be {@linkplain #exec(IActivity)
 * executed}.
 *
 * <p>There are two types of consumers. First, there are consumers that receive activities and hold
 * some state (such as remembering the currently active editor of each session participant), so
 * these states can be queried at any time without the need to wait for the next activity.<br>
 * The second type of consumers relies on the incoming activities (and maybe those states maintained
 * by the other consumers) and perform actions with visible effects, such as changing the local file
 * copies or displaying awareness information in the user interface.
 *
 * <p>The first type of consumers is called "passive" as they don't have an observable effect on
 * their environment. The second type are the "active" consumers as they provide the actual feature
 * that make up Saros. Since the actions at least sometimes of the latter rely on the first being
 * up-to-date, but never the other way around, passive consumers are always notified first about new
 * activities.
 *
 * <p>Usually, you don't need to implement this interface directly, but can simply extend the {@link
 * AbstractActivityConsumer} class which takes care of dispatching the activities based on their
 * type, so your logic will only be called for the {@link IActivity} implementations you're actually
 * interested in.
