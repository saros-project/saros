 * <h1>Concurrency Control Overview</h1>
 *
 * The Concurrency Control supports writing collaborations of multiple users. All participants of a
 * Saros session shall have a consistent copy of all shared resources.
 *
 * <p>The Concurrency Control comprises of four subpackages:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>jupiter --- this package contains the Jupiter Algorithm used for collaborative text editing
 *   <li>management --- manages all JupiterActivities (operations processed by the users of a Saros
 *       session with WRITE_ACCESS)
 *   <li>watchdog --- since inconsistencies might appear the Consistency Watchdog takes care of them
 *   <li>undo (not in core yet) --- package for undo/redo operations within a Saros session
 * </ul>
